# Degen Token Game with a Degen Store

This is my fourth module Eth+Avax submission. I have created a DeFi game which has a Degen store and deployed it to Avalanche.

## Description

In this module submission, I have created a smart contract which has all the ERC20 functionalities and an additional redeem function so that the items in the Degen store can be redeemed in exchange for tokens. For every item you redeem, the item number * 2000 tokens get burnt /deducted from the total supply.
